       <blockquote> <p><span style="color: rgb(210, 16, 16);">Myntra</span> is a one stop shop for all your fashion and lifestyle needs. Being India's largest e-commerce store for fashion and lifestyle products, Myntra aims at providing a hassle free and enjoyable shopping experience to shoppers across the country with the widest range of brands and products on its portal.
            Myntra is an Indian fashion e-commerce company headquartered in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India. The company was founded in 2007-2008 to sell personalized gift items. In May 2014, Myntra.com was acquired by Flipkart.
            On 10 May 2015, Myntra announced that it would shut down its website, and serve customers exclusively through its mobile app beginning 15 May. The service had already discontinued its mobile website in favour of the app.[17] Myntra justified its decision by stating that 95% of traffic on its website came via mobile devices, and that 70% of its purchases were performed on smartphones. 
            The move received mixed reception, and resulted in a 10% decline in sales.[18][19] In February 2016, acknowledging the failure of the "app-only" model, Myntra announced that it would revive its website</p></blockquote>

        <p style="color: rgb(10, 32, 12);">We’ve said it time and time again, menswear is ruled by history and tradition. Every person in menswear (designer, stylist, editor, etc) has taken inspiration from the past at one time or another. And no era has been overlooked.

            Therefore, as we continue to explore the foundations of personal style, I thought we’d take a quick look back at the last hundred-or-so years in men’s fashion. Perhaps this will provide a little insight or context as to how menswear shifts, and more importantly, how we can make informed decisions when it comes to buying clothing and developing personal style.</p>

<p>Todays womens clothing is a line of ultimate representation of a womans body confidence that will make her all the more stylish and glamorous. Find about the lessons of womens clothing and the cardinal rules of dressing up in relation to your body shape as you read on.</p>
<h5>1. The Summer style</h5>
<p>The heat is on! Pull on your khakis and that plain shirt. oooh, dont even try to. Plain tees are too boring to beat the heat. Get load and do it thru colors. Summer is all about kooky pattern mixes, wild and exotic colors. Try on some batiks or embroidered fabric tops, uniquely patterned skirts or clothes that are rich in colored pretty ruffles. If you want to still stick with your jeans, pair it up with off-the-shoulder tunic as a cover up.</p>
<h5>2. The Simple but elegant style</h5>
<p>Dressing up sexy does not always mean micro mini skirts and super tight tube tops. Try on some sassy classic look. Make it loose, not tight. Full-skirted, not gripping. Flatter the looseness of a longer, full-skirted dress that will go with your height and dont be afraid to stand out. Skinny and tall women will look good on belted dresses with stiff pleats that are so forties look.</p>
